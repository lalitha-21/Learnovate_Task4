            <h4>History
                1995: The domain Chess.com was originally set up by Aficionado, a company based in Berkeley, California, to sell a piece of chess tutoring software called "Chess Mentor".[4]
                2005: Internet entrepreneur Erik Allebest and partner Jarom ("Jay") Severson bought the domain name and assembled a team of software developers to redevelop the site as a chess portal.
                2007: The site was relaunched in 2007.[3] The site was heavily promoted via social media.
                2009: Chess.com announced a takeover of a similar chess social networking site, chesspark.com. Chesspark founders Jack Moffitt and Brian Zisk had moved to work on a web search startup.[5]
                October 2013: Chess.com acquired the Amsterdam-based chess news site chessvibes.com, which provided coverage for chess tournaments. It was founded and owned by Dutch chess journalist Peter Doggers in February 2006.[6][7]
                2014: The site announced that over a billion live games had been played on the site, including 100 million correspondence games.[8]
                January 2016: Chess.com announced "v3", the two-year overhaul of its previous interface. The site introduced new features including computer analysis of games, and the chess variants of crazyhouse, three-check chess, king of the hill, chess960 and bughouse.[9]
                June 2017: The 2,147,483,647th (= 231-1) game was played, which caused the iOS app to stop working for those with 32-bit Apple devices. This occurred because of an integer overflow problem whereby the number was too large to be represented in the number of storage bits that were used.[10][11][12]
                May 2018: Chess.com announced that it had acquired the 3300+ Elo-rated commercial chess engine Komodo, then ranked 3rd behind Stockfish and Houdini.[13] In conjunction, the Komodo team announced the addition of the probabilistic method of Monte Carlo tree search machine learning, the same methods used by the recent chess projects AlphaZero and Leela Chess Zero.[14]

                Titled Tuesdays
                Titled Tuesday is a 11-round Swiss-system 3+1 blitz chess tournament held on every Tuesday.[18] Grandmaster participants include Hikaru Nakamura, Maxime Vachier-Lagrave, Alexander Grischuk, Dmitry Andreikin, Wesley So, and Fabiano Caruana.[18] The first event was held on October 28, 2014, with a prize fund of $500 and was won by Baadur Jobava.[19] The prize fund was eventually upgraded to $1500.[18] GM Hikaru Nakamura has won the most events with a total of ten tournament wins, followed by GM Georg Meier with seven,[20] Magnus Carlsen has won three of the events in which he has partaken.[21]

        <h1>Super Mario</h1>
        <h4>Super Mario[a] is a platform game series created by Nintendo based on Mario.<br>
           Alternatively called the Super Mario Bros.[b] series or simply the Mario[c] series,<br> 
           it is the central series of the greater Mario franchise. At least one Super Mario game<br>
           has been released for every major Nintendo video game console. Many Super Mario<br>
           video games are on non-Nintendo platforms.[1] There are twenty-one similar games<br>
           and one cross-series game that may or may not be included as part of the series.<br>

            The Super Mario games are typically in the fictional Mushroom Kingdom with Mario as<br>
            the player character. He is often joined by his brother, Luigi, and occasionally by<br>
             other members of the Mario cast. As a platform game, the player runs and jumps across<br>
              platforms and atop enemies in themed levels. The games have simple plots, typically with<br>
               Mario rescuing the kidnapped Princess Peach from the primary antagonist, Bowser.<br>
                The first game in the series, Super Mario Bros., released for the Nintendo Entertainment<br>
                 System (NES) in 1985, established the series' gameplay concepts and elements.<br>
                  These include a multitude of power-ups and items that give Mario special powers<br>
                   such as fireball-throwing and size-changing into both giant and miniature sizes.[2]<br>
            
            The Super Mario series is part of the greater Mario franchise, which includes other video <br>
            game genres and media such as film, television, printed media, and merchandise. More than <br>
            380 million copies of Super Mario games have been sold worldwide, making it the fourth-bestselling<br>
            video game series, </h4>
